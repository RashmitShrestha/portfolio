Day 1:
 The Dues Avon! What a glorious vessel! I’ve never been in a ship so big or so luxurious. As soon as I entered, I felt a blast of excitement while the red velvet curtains blew in the sea breeze. An employee happily escorted me to my room and I began my vacation. But since the cruise ship was massive, I got lost. Finally I ended up in the captain's room. His name was Sivian Dearix. Turns out he used to be a submarine pilot in the military. After our introduction session, Sivian nicely escorted me to my room. What a nice guy!

Day 2:
	As soon as I got out from bed, I headed to the hot tub on the upper deck to relax and enjoy the ocean. After rubbing off myself with a towel, a group of young teens ran past me talking about something called a “Bermuda Triangle”. I felt like I’ve heard of it before in a children’s book. A younger, more clumsier boy tried to follow the group but accidently bumped in to me. I asked him, “ What’s the rush”. He replied, “ Sorry, my brothers were talking about how ships and planes disappear in this thing called a Bermuda Triangle but, I have to tag my brothers then, they’ll tell me what it is.” I went to the library on the cruise ship to find out more on the Bermuda Triangle. The Bermuda Triangle is an area of ocean where ships and planes disappear.

Day 3:
	Today the day was a little foggy but I won’t let that stop my fun. When I leaned against the rail, I noticed that the water was looking a bit colorful. It was as if a rainbows was reflected on the water. Suddenly, the cruise ship tilts at a 15 degree angle and I almost fall of the boat. I think nothing of it and continue to go on with my day. But then again, the ship starts to rumble violently then stop. I immediately go to the Captain Sivian’s quarter and report the problem to him. Sivian informs,” Bubbles of methane rise under the ship and try to tilt it but, we added more buoyancy to counter the problems!” In my head, I feared that my fate would be similar to the Titanic but, I rememmbered that we’re now in a modern age where things like that don’t happen.
<br ></br >
Day 4:
	Today, one of the most scariest things happened in my life. Captain Sivian had informed everyone through speakers that, they were going to approach stormy seas. I heard a kid start crying across the table. But other than that, nobody cared. Right after the kid stopped crying, the whole shipped violently shook. All of the children on the ship started bawling. Sivian announced,” The vessel is taking in water, everyone report to the lifeboats!” We rushed to the lifeboats and took our seats when without warning, a lightning bolt struck the front of the ship, leaving fires and flames everywhere. Soon enough, the alarm went on and the lights died out. Massive funnels of wind teared out chunks and the ships along with some people. Finally, a gas tank exploded near me and I fell into the sea while being unconscious.
<br ></br >
Day 5:
5 days later, I wake up on an island in the middle of nowhere. My shirt was torn to pieces and I had scars and cuts all over my body. My waterproof phone was still intact. So using my knowledge from engineering classes, I used the battery on the phone to start a fire. I built a signal fire and three days later, a rescue helicopter came and pick me up. Right after I blended into civilization, I made this website to inform and entertain any viewers who want to know about the Bermuda Triangle.
