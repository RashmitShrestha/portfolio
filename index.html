                                        Enough with that, now I‚Äôm going to expand on why I would be an excellent junior
                                        class council member.
                                        <b>My goal is to supply you with a plethora of prudent reasons on why you should
                                            vote for me, instead of only begging you to do so.</b> </h4>

                                    </br>
                                    <p style="font-size: 17px;">Ever since I was a kid, <b>I loved organizing just about
                                            anything:</b> the paintings in my house, the books on my shelf,
                                        even stratagies on how to eat my food! (Rice, curry, rice, water, curry, a
                                        potato). This level of thinking was
                                        carried on throughout the rest of my life. And so far, I‚Äôve hosted and organized
                                        events for the Nepali community,
                                        I‚Äôve managed clubs, and I‚Äôve helped out with some high school-ran businesses. As
                                        a gift from my parents, <b>I instinctively scrutinize
                                            every detail and outcome, making me ready and aware for anything. </b>
                                        I believe these experiences and skills will be valuable
                                        to the leadership team, making me a well-qualified canidate. </p>
                                    </br>

                                    <p style="font-size: 17px;"><b>Another feature that will greatly serve the class
                                            council is my history with designing. </b>I‚Äôve been exposed to many
                                        subsets of design from architecture, to logo design, to serving as a front-end
                                        web developer. My passion for
                                        design started from trying to sketch a transformer, Bumblebee to be specific. To
                                        save you some time, my end
                                        result was a deformed car that looked like it had a large dent on the back of
                                        its head. <i>I don‚Äôt even know
                                            how I managed to do that.</i> But when it was time to color, it felt like
                                        this was something I could do for
                                        hours and hours on end. After that, <b>I began takings some more opportunities
                                            to find out what I enjoyed, able
                                            to do those actions with continuity.</b> I started gaining more and more
                                        experience from sources such as youtube videos
                                        and friends who are much better at art than me. But still, I‚Äôm certain that my
                                        skills would greatly benefit
                                        the school. </p>
                                    </br>

                                    <p style="font-size: 17px;">The last reason for why I‚Äôm qualification is based on my
                                        Y&G experiences. Ever since I‚Äôve
                                        joined Y&G, <b>I've been exposed to countless examples of what a good leader
                                            acts, thinks, and speaks like. Using all their passed down knowledge,
                                            I will help create a better school for everyone. For example, I‚Äôve gained so much
                                            enlightment on how powerful our voices are, how anything can happen
                                            if you‚Äôre willing to work hard, and how you should stand up for what you
                                            believe in despite what anyone
                                            says. </b> I‚Äôve learned about all of these incredible things from the help
                                        of wonderful people who have
                                        been there throughout my high school journey. <b>Learning about other people‚Äôs
                                            aspirations and goals paved
                                            the path to what I want to do and how I want to appear in front of the
                                            world.</b> If it weren‚Äôt for all
                                        the people who have left a positive effect on me, I might not have run to be a

                                        team, and I definitely wouldn‚Äôt have. And there would be no way I
                                        would run for any leadership
                                        positions if it weren‚Äôt for Y&G. </p>

                        <p>Hailing from Nepal, he is an adaptable, tenacious, and reliable student, who
                            currently attends Albany High School in California. He believes that technology
                            has the power to solve any problems humans are faced with in the future, so he
                            wants to help build, upgrade, and create new technologies that will inevitably
                            improve life for all. In his free time, he likes to do Taekwondo, run, and meditate.
                            In addition to coding, he enjoys being an officer of a program called Youth & Government
                            which is about politics and mending the world‚Äôs problems. Rashmit fluently speaks two
                            languages
                            at the moment, English and Nepali, but is learning Korean, Spanish, and German. He loves
                            learning
                            and exploring new things so he can help people around the world one day.
